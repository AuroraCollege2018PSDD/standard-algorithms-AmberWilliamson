## Number Array handling
* Load and print an array
* Sum numbers in an array

Using pseudocode, flowcharts and python write a program which:
* consists of a main routine, a load array routine, a print array routine and a sum array routine
* stubs for subroutines to find the maximum and minimum value in the the array
* asks the user if they want to load numbers into the array, print the array, sum the array, find the maximum, find the minimum or quit

The main routine should:
* control the flow of the program
* exit without crashing when appropriate

The load array routine should:
* prompt the user to enter a number
* check that the entered value is valid
* add the number to the array
* return the program to the main routine when user enters a sentinal value such as "xxx"

The print array routine should:
* print out the values in the array
* print out the total number of elements in the array
* return the program to the main routine

The sum array routine should:
* print out the sum total of the values in the array
* print out the number of elements in the array
* return the program to the main routine

The stubs for maximum and minimum should:
* print a message indicating that they have been called
* return the program to the main routine

You should then desk check your code and algorithms by:
* preparing test data that checks all boundary conditions, paths etc
* using a table of variables and values to step through each step in the program

When you have finished you need to compare your code to one of your classmate's and comment on the:
*	Similarities and differences
*	Strengths and weakness of each approach.
